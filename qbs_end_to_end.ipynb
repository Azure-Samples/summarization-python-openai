    "# Query Based Summarization Solution Playbook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge bases in enterprises are very common in the industry today and can have extensive number of documents in different categories. Retrieving relevant content based on a user query is a challenging task.  Given a query we were able to retrieve information accurately at the document level using methods such as Page Rank developed and made highly accurate especially by Google,  after this point the user has to delve into the document and search for the relevant information.  With recent advances in Foundation Transformer Models such as the one developed by Open AI the challenge is alleviated by using “Semantic Search” methods by using encoding information such as “Embeddings” to find the relevant information and then to summarize the content to present to the user in a concise and succinct manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Playbook will introduce the releavant use cases and the end-to-end archtitecture for this use case. We wuill take you through the step-by-step process of using various Azure Cognitive Services and more specifically Azure OpenAI's GPT-3 models to perform the downstream task of summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This playbook aims to demonstrate how to link various Azure Cognitive Services together to improve results for common downstream tasks in a large enterprise enviorment. The methods and architecture are extremely customizable to your summarization use case and can be applied to many different datasets.\n"

    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "This playbook links together two main use cases: **Document Search** and **Document Summarization**. By using different Azure Cognitive Services specialized for each task, the end result is focused, succinct, and thoroughly vetted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Search is driven by an initial user query. The user provides their query to the search service, enabling users to find the top most relevant document from their knowledge base. Document Search leverages the state of the art search technology using indexers. Within large enteprises there are various documents in different formats that are congregated in a large knowledge base. Having the ability to quickly, effectively, and accurately find relevant documents is essential to this end-to-end scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Summarization is performed by providing input quality text into the summarizaton engine. The key to successful document summarization is retrieving the most important points within a large document to feed into summarization, as the quality and focus of a summary is only as good as the input data. To ensure the most succinct and focused summary is returned, we utitlize Embeddings to search within a document for the most salient pieces. Document Summarization is essential in large enteprises to condense large documents into human consumable information that frees up humans to do more specialized and techincal work rather than focus on common tasks such as summmarization."

    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "An E2E architecture found in Images/EndToEndArchitecture.png captures the use case that we talked about the previous sections. The user passes their query to a knowledge base to filter the number of documents top most relevant docouments, narrows the scope of documents to tens from a couple of thousands. This cna be done using Azure Cognitive Search by creating a custom index for your knowledge base. Then once a document is selected, the document needs to be segmented and then each segment can be embedded using GPT-3 embedding models. This allows each text chunk to have its semantic meaning captured through an embedding. Then the user can send another query to search within the document and \"zone in\" on a particular text segment or segements based using similarities between the query and embeddings for each text chunk. Once a section is \"zoned-in\", the user can extract the relevant text and pass it to the GPT-3 Completion endpoint for summarization. "

    "\n",
    "An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be\n",
    "easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding\n",
    "is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a\n",
    "piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers,\n",
    "such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is\n",
    "correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original\n",
    "format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector\n",
    "representations should also be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different Azure OpenAI embedding models are specifically created to be\n",
    "good at a particular task. Similarity embeddings are good at capturing\n",
    "semantic similarity between two or more pieces of text. Text search\n",
    "embeddings help measure long documents are relevant to a short query.\n",
    "Code search embeddings are useful for embedding code snippets and\n",

    "\n",
    "Embeddings make it easier to do machine learning on large inputs\n",
    "representing words by capturing the semantic similarities in a vector\n",
    "space. Therefore, we can use embeddings to if two text chunks are\n",
    "semantically related or similar, and inherently provide a score to\n",
    "assess similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cosine Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "A previously used approach to match similar documents was based on\n",
    "counting maximum number of common words between documents. This is\n",
    "flawed since as the document size increases, the overlap of common words\n",
    "increases even if the topics differ. Therefore cosine similarity is a\n",
    "better approach by using the Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle\n",
    "between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. This is\n",
    "beneficial because if two documents are far apart by Euclidean distance\n",
    "because of size, they could still have a smaller angle between them and\n",
    "therefore higher cosine similarity.\n",

    "Now that we have extracted the relevant context chunks using Azure OpenAI Embedding API, we can use these chunks to provide meaningful context for our prompt design. We will be using the **Completion endpoint** for summarization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, let's design a prompt used for summarizing our extracted texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Design Refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-3 models can perform many tasks. Therefore you must be explicit in describing what you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "The models try to guess what you want from the prompt. If you send the words \"Give me a list of cat breeds,\" the model wouldn't automatically assume that you're asking for a list of cat breeds. You could just as easily be asking the model to continue a conversation where the first words are \"Give me a list of cat breeds\" and the next ones are \"and I'll tell you which ones I like.\" If the model only assumed that you wanted a list of cats, it wouldn't be as good at content creation, classification, or other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three basic guidelines to creating prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Show and tell**. Make it clear what you want either through instructions, examples, or a combination of the two. If you want the model to rank a list of items in alphabetical order or to classify a paragraph by sentiment, show it that's what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Provide quality data**. If you're trying to build a classifier or get the model to follow a pattern, make sure that there are enough examples. Be sure to proofread your examples — the model is usually smart enough to see through basic spelling mistakes and give you a response, but it also might assume this is intentional and it can affect the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Check your settings.** The temperature and top_p settings control how deterministic the model is in generating a response. If you're asking it for a response where there's only one right answer, then you'd want to set these lower. If you're looking for more diverse responses, then you might want to set them higher. The number one mistake people use with these settings is assuming that they're \"cleverness\" or \"creativity\" controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Few-Shot Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this is to teach the GPT-3 model to learn a conversation style input. We use the “Completion” create OpenAI API and generate a prompt that would best provide us a summary of the conversation. It is important to generate prompts carefully to extract relevant information. To extract general summaries from customer-agent chats, we will be using the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prefix: What do you want it to do\n",
    "2. Context primer : Describe what the context is\n",
    "3. Context: # Essentially the information needed to answer the question. In the case of summary, the prose that needs to be summarized. \n",
    "4. Suffix: Describe what form the answer should take. Whether it is an answer, a completion, a summary, etc"

    "To summarize, we started by transferring a large knowledge base of data to **Azure Blob Storage**. We also deployed a **Azure Cognitive Search** service by creating a custom indexer for our data. From there, the user provided an initial query in the Azure Cognitive Search app that searched against the Blob Storage. The **enterprise search** results were listed as an output based on Azure Cognitive Search's similarity metric. From there, we **isolated the top search result** and extracated the text. At this point we are now focusing on one document relevant to the initial query. From here, we **chunked** our document to break up the long document into individual chunks. Then we utilized **Azure OpenAI Embedding API** to embed each context vector and asssign a representation semantic meaning to each chunk. Then we created a document specific query that will enable us to **\"zone in\"** on a specific section of the document that we want to use for our downstream task. After passing the document specific query, we used Embeddings to find the most **relevant context chunks** to the query. From there we extracted the relevant context chunks, and designed a **few-shot prompt** for the **Azure OpenAI Completion API** for the downstream task of summarization. \n",

    "From starting from a 11.2K document knowledge base to narrowing onto a specific document, and then finding the relevant inforamtion within the document to generate the best summary - linking Azure Cognitive services is an excellent approach.\n"
